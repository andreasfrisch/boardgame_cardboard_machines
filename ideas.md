## Further Ideas

### Weapons
At the beginning of the game each player draws 3 weapon cards and picks one to keep.

Every time a player passes the starting line, that player will draw X cards and choose one to keep.
X is equal to 2 plus twice the number of round markers the player have, including any they just received for crossing the starting line.

#### Weapon Ideas
* Rocket (fire up to 6 spaces straight ahead. Roll X, x=distance, stress dice counting only swerve symbols for the rocket)
* Machine Guns (hit the first car in a straight line, up to 4 away)
* Mines (place a mine marker on the board after leaving a spot)
* Oil (place an oil marker to the side of the card)
* Jet Boost (Move up to two extra spaces immediately, roll an additional stress die this turn)
